"""
I think the show operations method is a bit wonky. I am not sure about the last operation, specifically this
extra part about destination with most passengers you asked to implemnt. So far, I use the set to grab unique
values, but then I have to loop thourgh the oriringal lips to see if there is a match, it feels a bit backwards,
but right now I am not certain how to fix it. Maybe there is a more ennhanced comparison.

All the code I wrote is the original code, based on what we studied and based on what I remember + googling.
I improved almost nothing, but I expect you may see an improvement here. I think there could be use for more
enhanced if statements, it has been a while since I used them. For now, this should work as you require.
